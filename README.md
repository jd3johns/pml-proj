Coursera: Practical Machine Learning Project

As a part of the Coursera Practical Machine Learning course offered by John Hopkins University, I completed an analysis of a multi-participant barbell curl sensor data set which I used to train a random forest machine learning model. This model was used to predict from a test set whether a participant was doing the exercise correctly, and if so which variation of mistake he or she was making. The accuracy on the test set was 100%, with all data classified correctly.
